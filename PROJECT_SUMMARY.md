## How It Works

### User Flow

#### Viewers (Default)
1. Open app URL
2. See live scores updating in real-time
3. Navigate between round tabs
4. View cumulative leaderboard
5. No login required

#### Scorers (Editor Mode)
1. Click "I'm the Scorer"
2. Enter PIN (default: 0509)
3. System signs in anonymously
4. Claims editor lock in Firestore
5. All inputs become enabled
6. Enter scores - auto-saves every 300ms
7. Click "Release Editor" when done
8. System releases lock and signs out

### Data Flow

```
User Input → Optimistic State Update → Display Updated UI
     ↓
Debounced (300ms)
     ↓
Firestore Write (with editor auth check)
     ↓
Real-time Listener Triggers
     ↓
All Connected Clients Update
```

### Security Model

```
Client wants to write score
     ↓
Is user authenticated? (Anonymous Auth)
     ↓ Yes
Does editor lock doc have their uid?
     ↓ Yes
Firestore allows write
     ↓
Score saved
```

### Scoring Logic

#### Birdies & Eagles
- Automatically calculated from strokes vs par
- Birdie = 1 under par
- Eagle = 2+ under par

#### Front/Back 9 Winners
- Sum strokes for holes 1-9 and 10-18
- Lowest score wins 3 points
- Ties = no points awarded

#### Round Winners
- **Strokeplay**: Lowest total strokes = 10 pts
- **Stableford**: Highest total points = 10 pts
- **Matchplay**: Manual selection = 10 pts

## Next Steps (For You)

### 1. Immediate Setup
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Firebase Configuration
- Create project
- Enable Firestore & Anonymous Auth
- Deploy security rules
- Copy config to `.env.local`

### 3. Initialize Data
- Run app locally: `npm run dev`
- Sign in with PIN
- Click "Initialize Database"

### 4. Deploy to Vercel
```bash
vercel
```
Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard.

### 5. Customize (Optional)
- Change PIN in environment variables
- Update player names in `lib/seed.ts`
- Adjust course data in `lib/data/courses.ts`
- Modify round formats in `lib/data/rounds.ts`

## Technology Choices Explained

### Why Next.js 14 App Router?
- Modern React with Server Components
- Built-in routing
- Optimized for production
- Easy Vercel deployment

### Why Firebase?
- Real-time database out of the box
- No backend code needed
- Generous free tier
- Simple authentication

### Why Anonymous Auth?
- No user registration needed
- Secure with server-side rules
- Session-based access
- Easy to implement

### Why Tailwind?
- Fast development
- Consistent design system
- Small bundle size
- Mobile-first utilities

## Known Limitations & Considerations

### Current Limitations
1. **Single Editor**: Only one person can score at a time
2. **Client-side PIN**: PIN is visible in source code (acceptable for private event)
3. **No History**: Score changes aren't versioned
4. **No Offline Mode**: Requires internet connection

### Future Enhancements (Optional)
- [ ] Score change history/audit log
- [ ] Multiple simultaneous editors (different rounds)
- [ ] Player authentication for viewing
- [ ] Score entry validation warnings
- [ ] Export to PDF/CSV
- [ ] Photo upload per hole
- [ ] Weather conditions tracking
- [ ] Push notifications for score updates

## Performance

### Expected Metrics
- **Initial Load**: < 2s
- **Score Update**: ~100ms (optimistic)
- **Real-time Sync**: ~500ms
- **Firestore Reads**: ~5,000/day (well within free tier)
- **Firestore Writes**: ~500/day (well within free tier)

### Optimizations Implemented
- Debounced writes (reduces Firestore operations)
- Optimistic UI updates (instant feedback)
- Proper React hooks (prevents unnecessary re-renders)
- Lazy loading with dynamic imports (smaller bundles)

## Testing Checklist

Before going live:
- [ ] Test PIN entry and editor lock
- [ ] Enter scores for a few holes
- [ ] Check real-time updates in another browser
- [ ] Release editor and re-claim
- [ ] Test on mobile device
- [ ] Verify leaderboard calculations
- [ ] Test all round tabs
- [ ] Check GIR overall winner selection
