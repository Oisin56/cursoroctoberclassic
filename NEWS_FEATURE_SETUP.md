## Setup Steps

### Step 1: Upload Firestore Rules ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRED

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **Firestore Database ‚Üí Rules**
4. Copy the contents of `firestore.rules` from this project
5. Paste and **Publish**

**What this does**: Enables the news collection with proper permissions.

### Step 2: Create Firestore Index (First-time setup)

When you first try to load the app after deploying, you might see an error about a missing index.

**Solution**:
1. Check your browser console for an error message
2. It will contain a direct link to create the index
3. Click the link (it will open Firebase Console)
4. Click **Create Index** button
5. Wait 1-2 minutes for the index to build

**Manual setup** (if no link appears):
1. Go to **Firestore Database ‚Üí Indexes**
2. Click **Create Index**
3. Collection ID: `news`
4. Add fields:
   - Field: `eventId`, Order: `Ascending`
   - Field: `createdAt`, Order: `Descending`
5. Click **Create**

### Step 3: Upload Player Photos üì∏

Player photos are stored in `public/images/`. You need to add:

- **`neil.jpg`** - Photo of Neil Hyland
- **`oisin.jpg`** - Photo of Ois√≠n O'Carroll

**Recommended specs**:
- Square format (800x800px)
- JPG format
- Under 1MB file size

**How to upload**:

#### Option A: Drag & Drop (Easiest)
1. Open `public/images` folder in your file explorer
2. Drag and drop your photos
3. Rename them to exactly `neil.jpg` and `oisin.jpg`
4. Commit and push to GitHub

#### Option B: Terminal
```bash
cp /path/to/neil-photo.jpg public/images/neil.jpg
cp /path/to/oisin-photo.jpg public/images/oisin.jpg

git add public/images/
git commit -m "Add player photos"
git push
```

**Without photos**: The app will display placeholder gradient backgrounds.
