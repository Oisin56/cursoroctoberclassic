# üîÑ Day 1 Data Migration Guide

This guide will help you preserve your Day 1 AM and Day 1 PM data while reseeding the database with the new tournament schedule.

## What Changed

‚úÖ **Mount Juliet** - Changed from Strokeplay to **Stableford**  
‚úÖ **Tab Labels** - Changed to "Day 1 AM", "Day 1 PM", etc.  
‚úÖ **D4 (Galway)** - Removed from tournament  
‚úÖ **Day 2 PM** - Changed to **Matchplay**  

## Step-by-Step Migration

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This installs `tsx` which is needed to run the migration script.

### Step 2: Create .env.local File

If you haven't already, create a `.env.local` file in the project root with your Firebase credentials:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_EDITOR_PIN=your_pin
```

### Step 3: Export Day 1 Data

Run this command to backup your Day 1 AM and Day 1 PM data:

```bash
npm run migrate:export
```

You should see:
```
‚úì Found round: D1 AM (Ballyliffin Old)
‚úì Found round: D1 PM (Ballyliffin Glashedy)
‚úì Found score: Oisin - Round ...
‚úì Found score: Neil - Round ...
‚úÖ Backup complete! Saved to: backups/day1-backup-xxxxx.json
```

The backup file is saved in the `backups/` folder.

### Step 4: Reseed the Database

Now go to your app:

1. Open your app in the browser
2. Click **"I'm the Scorer"** and enter your PIN
3. Scroll to the bottom-right corner
4. Click **"Clear All & Re-seed"** button
5. Confirm the action
6. Wait for success message

### Step 5: Restore Day 1 Data

After reseeding completes, run:

```bash
npm run migrate:import
```

You should see:
```
‚úì Restored course: Ballyliffin Old
‚úì Restored course: Ballyliffin Glashedy
‚úì Restored score: Oisin - D1 AM
‚úì Restored score: Neil - D1 AM
‚úì Restored score: Oisin - D1 PM
‚úì Restored score: Neil - D1 PM
‚úÖ Day 1 data successfully restored!
```

### Step 6: Verify

1. Hard refresh your browser (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Check the tabs - you should see:
   - ‚úÖ Day 1 AM (with your data preserved)
   - ‚úÖ Day 1 PM (with your data preserved)
   - ‚úÖ Day 2 AM
   - ‚úÖ Day 2 PM (Matchplay)
   - ‚úÖ Day 3 AM
   - ‚úÖ Day 3 PM
   - ‚úÖ Day 4 (Mount Juliet - Stableford)
   - ‚ùå No D4 (Galway) - correctly removed

## Troubleshooting

### "No backup file found"
- Make sure you ran `npm run migrate:export` first
- Check the `backups/` folder exists

### "No Day 1 rounds found"
- Your database might already be reseeded
- Check if your rounds have labels "D1 AM" and "D1 PM" (old) or "Day 1 AM" and "Day 1 PM" (new)

### Firebase connection errors
- Make sure your `.env.local` file has the correct Firebase credentials
- Check that your Firebase project allows connections from your IP
